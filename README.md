# Baseball Card

This is a Python application built using Tkinter that displays a baseball card for a selected player. It retrieves player statistics from the MLB (Major League Baseball) API and displays them in a graphical user interface.

## Features
- **Player Information:** Displays the player's headshot, name, position, bat side, pitch hand, and MLB debut date.
- **Career Statistics:** Displays various hitting statistics for the player's career, including games played, plate appearances, at bats, runs, hits, total bases, doubles, triples, home runs, RBIs, walks, strikeouts, stolen bases, batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and on-base plus slugging.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- requests library
- statsapi library

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. The application will display the baseball card for the selected player with their headshot and career statistics.
3. You can change the player by modifying the `player_id` variable in the code.

## Note
